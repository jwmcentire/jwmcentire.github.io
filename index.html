     <h1>Welcome to Jason's Programming Portfolio</h1>
    <p>My name is Jason and I am an active duty Sailor currently stationed out of Newport, RI. I am originally from the Upstate of South Carolina and have been enlisted in the U.S Navy as a Fire Controlman Aegis (FCA) technician for close to eight years now. This website will be utilized as my portfolio for my CSC106 Computer Programming course at the University of Rhode Island.
